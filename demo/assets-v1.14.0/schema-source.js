// The rest of the pipeline is already pure and importable: selection reduces
// tables to a subset, mermaid-definition turns a subset into an erDiagram
// string, viewport does the transform maths. Reading the API envelope into the
// state those run on lived inline in truss.js, so anything embedding Truss's
// diagram in a page of its own (an admin panel, a Livewire component) had to
// make an HTTP request to its own application to get at it, even though
// `Truss::payload()` hands it the same array in PHP.
//
// Two ways in, and Truss's own dashboard still uses the first:
//
//   - fetch the JSON endpoint, then readPayload() the response
//   - embed the payload in the page, then inlinePayload() it and readPayload()
//     the result, with no request at all
//
// Structure only, like everything else here: this reads what the server chose to
// send and never asks for more.
